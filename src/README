To install:
	Python3:
		Type into terminal the following (you may need root privileges with sudo):
		(if you already installed this, add --upgrade to the end to update the package)
		(numpy will be installed if it is not already)

			python3 -m pip install spikegadgets_python/

		To use:

			$ python3
			>>> from spikegadgets import trodesnetwork

	Anaconda:
		For some versions of Anaconda (4.x.x and below), if you run into an error when importing, you must also run the following:
			
			conda install libgcc
			pip install numpy --upgrade

	C++:
		More complicated than Python, since there is no built in package system and you have to build your programs

		1. Copy the folders include/ and lib/ into your application directory. 
		2. In your build, make sure you add the path to include/ for include directories and add the path to lib/ for library directories. 
		3. Include files in your source code like the following:

			#include "TrodesNetwork/AbstractModuleClient.h"

To test after installing:
	Python: 
		1. Run Trodes on any simple config file
		2. Connect to a simulator stream (Connection -> Source -> Simulation)
			* It should work on any source but for testing, use simulated.
		3. Start streaming
		4. Run: python3 examples/testnetwork.py
